## How to Run the Project

### Backend (API Server)
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string:
    ```env
    PORT=3545
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/bookdb
    ```
4.  Ensure MongoDB is running.
5.  Start the server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

### Frontend (Web App)
1.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the frontend app:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** for unit and integration testing, **Supertest** for API endpoint testing, and **Keploy** for automated API testing.

### Traditional Testing (Jest + Supertest)

#### How to Run Tests
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Run all tests:
    ```sh
    npm test
    ```
3.  To generate a coverage report:
    ```sh
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

### Keploy API Testing

#### Overview
Keploy is an open-source API testing tool that automatically generates test cases by recording real API interactions. It provides:
- **Automated test case generation** from real API calls
- **Database mocking** for isolated testing
- **Test replay** functionality
- **CI/CD integration** capabilities

#### Keploy Setup

##### Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Keploy CLI installed

##### Configuration Files
The project includes the following Keploy configuration:

1. **keploy.yml** - Main Keploy configuration
2. **tests.yaml** - Generated test cases covering all CRUD operations
3. **mocks.yaml** - Database mocks for isolated testing

##### Test Cases Generated
The `tests.yaml` file includes comprehensive test coverage:

| Test ID | Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| test-0 | GET | /api/books | Get all books (empty) |
| test-1 | POST | /api/books | Create new book |
| test-2 | GET | /api/books | Get all books after creation |
| test-3 | GET | /api/books/:id | Get book by ID |
| test-4 | PUT | /api/books/:id | Update book by ID |
| test-5 | DELETE | /api/books/:id | Delete book by ID |
| test-6 | GET | /api/books | Verify deletion (empty) |

#### Running Keploy Tests

##### 1. Start MongoDB Container
```bash
docker run -d --name mongodb --network keploy-network -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
```

##### 2. Build and Run Backend Container
```bash
docker build -t book-api .
docker run -d --name book-api --network keploy-network -p 3545:3545 book-api
```

##### 3. Record Test Cases (Optional)
```bash
keploy record --cport 3545
```

##### 4. Run Keploy Tests
```bash
keploy test --cport 3545 --delay 10
```

#### Keploy Test Results
The Keploy integration successfully:
-  Generated 7 comprehensive test cases
-  Covered all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-  Included proper HTTP headers and status codes
-  Created realistic request/response data
-  Configured database mocks for isolated testing

#### Benefits of Keploy Integration
1. **Automated Testing**: Reduces manual test case creation
2. **Real-world Testing**: Tests actual API behavior
3. **Database Mocking**: Isolated testing without external dependencies
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Easy integration into deployment pipelines
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all endpoints with realistic data
